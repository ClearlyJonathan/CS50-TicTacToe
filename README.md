📝 Description
This repository contains my solution to the Tic Tac Toe project from Harvard's CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (2024). The project implements an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI using the Minimax algorithm with recursive game-tree search.

🎮 Features
Turn-based Tic Tac Toe engine in Python

AI plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm

Detects terminal states, draws, and winning moves

Clean, modular design with player(), actions(), result(), winner(), and utility() functions

🧠 Core Concepts
Game theory and adversarial search

Recursion and backtracking

Optimal decision making with Minimax

Zero-sum utility evaluation

📂 Structure
tictactoe.py — Core logic and AI strategy

runner.py — Command-line interface to play/test the game

README.md — Project overview and instructions
