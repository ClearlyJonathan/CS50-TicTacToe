# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe AI â€“ CS50 AI 2024 Project 0

This is my solution to [CS50's AI Project 0: Tic Tac Toe](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/tictactoe/), where I implemented an unbeatable AI agent using the **Minimax algorithm** with optimal decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Full implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game logic
- Minimax algorithm with recursion to simulate all possible future moves
- AI that never loses â€“ it either wins or draws
- Intelligent move selection for both 'X' and 'O'

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The AI evaluates all possible game states recursively to determine the optimal move. It assumes the opponent plays optimally and chooses the path that leads to the best guaranteed outcome.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `tictactoe.py`: Core logic, including game rules and Minimax algorithm
- `runner.py`: A basic command-line interface to play against the AI
- `README.md`: This file

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3

No external libraries required.

## âœ… Usage

```bash
python runner.py
